                One thing before we move forward, the term Linux is actually quite 
                a misnomer, since it actually refers to the Linux kernel. 
                However, many distributions use the Linux kernel so therefore are 
                commonly known as Linux operating systems.
                <br><br>
                A Linux system is divided into three main parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system 
                        runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.</li>
                    <li>Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core 
                        of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it 
                        how to interact with the system.</li>
                    <li>User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly 
                        interacting with the system.</li>
                </ul>
                So the first step we’ll need to take is to install Linux on your machine.
                You have many options to choose from.
                <br><br>
                There are many Linux distributions to choose from, we’ll just go over 
                the most popular options.

        <!-- Debian -->
        <div class="slide" id="slide2">
            <div class="slide-header">Debian</div>
            <div class="slide-content">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Debian is an operating system composed entirely of free and 
                open-source software. It’s widely known and has been in development for 
                over 20 years. There are three branches that you can use, Stable, 
                Testing and Unstable.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Stable is an overall good branch to be on. Testing and 
                Unstable are rolling releases. This means that any incremental changes 
                in those branches will eventually become Stable. For example, if you 
                wanted to get to the next update from Windows XP to Windows 10, you’ll 
                have to do a complete Windows 10 installation. However being on the 
                Testing release, you’ll automatically get updates until it becomes the 
                next operating system release without having to do a full installation.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Debian also uses Debian package management tools. 
                Every Linux distribution installs and manages packages differently and 
                they use different package management tools. We’ll get more into this 
                in a later course.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Debian may not get the latest updates, but it's extremely 
                stable. If you want a good "core" operating system, this is the one for
                you.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Debian is an overall great operating system for any platform.

        <!-- RHEL -->
        <div class="slide" id="slide3">
            <div class="slide-header">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</div>
            <div class="slide-content">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Red Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is 
                developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free 
                re-distribution although it still provides source code for free.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, 
                RPM package manager, which we will eventually learn about as well.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the 
                Debian-based operating systems, most noticeably in package management. 
                If you decide to go with RHEL it’s probably best if you know 
                you’ll be working with it.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;As described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, 
                so if you need a solid server OS this would be a good one.

            <div class="slide-content">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most popular Linux distributions for personal 
                machines is Ubuntu. Ubuntu also releases its own desktop environment 
                manager Unity by default.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Ubuntu is a Debian-based operating system developed by 
                Canonical. So it uses a core Debian package management system.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Ubuntu is a great choice for a beginner who wants to get 
                into Linux. Ubuntu offers ease of use and a great user interface 
                experience that has led to its wide adoption. It’s widely used and 
                supported and is most like other operating systems like OSX and Windows 
                in terms of usability.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Great for any platform, desktop, laptop and server.

            <div class="slide-content">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by Red Hat, the Fedora Project is community driven 
                containing open-source and free software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
                branches off Fedora, so think of Fedora as an upstream RHEL operating 
                system. Eventually RHEL will get updates from Fedora after thorough 
                testing and quality assurance. Think of Fedora as an Ubuntu equivalent 
                that uses a Red Hat backend instead of Debian.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Uses Red Hat package manager.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use a Red Hat based operating system, 
                this is a user friendly version.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</dtrong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Fedora is great if you want a Red Hat based operating 
                system without the price tag. Recommended for desktop and laptop.

            <div class="slide-content">
                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Linux Mint is based off of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu’s 
                software repositories so the same packages are available on both 
                distributions. If you prefer a lighter distro than Ubuntu, you may be 
                interested in Linux Mint.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Since Linux Mint is Ubuntu based, it uses the Debian package
                manager.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Great user interface, great for beginners and less bloated 
                than Ubuntu. In this course, I’ll be using Linux Mint, but any other 
                distribution can be used.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Great for desktop and laptop.

                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Gentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating 
                system at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting 
                their hands dirty with the system.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Gentoo uses its own package management, Portage. 
                The Portage package management is very modular and easy to maintain, 
                which plays a big part in the operating system as a whole being 
                very flexible.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take 
                a more difficult path, I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as your 
                distribution.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>

                <strong>Overview</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Arch is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution 
                driven 100% by the community. Similar to Debian, Arch uses a rolling 
                release model so incremental updates eventually become the Stable 
                release. You really need to get your hands dirty to understand the 
                system and its functions, but in turn you get complete and total 
                control of your system.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Package Management</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;It uses its own package manager, Pacman, to install, 
                update and manage packages.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Configurability</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;If you want a lightweight operating system and really want 
                to understand Linux use Arch! There’s a bit of a learning curve, 
                but for the hardcore Linux users, this is a great choice.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Uses</strong><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Great for desktop and laptop. If you also have a small 
                device such as a Raspberry Pi and need to stick a lightweight OS on it, 
                you can’t go wrong with Arch.
